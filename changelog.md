### **Date**: 2025-08-10 06:30
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: PM Board project setup and issue creation
- **Created PM Board Project**: "PM Board" in Linear workspace
- **Created 9 issues** (HAR-8 to HAR-17) with dependency structure for parallel subagent development:
  - **Foundation**: HAR-8 (Database schema) → HAR-10 (API server)
  - **Parallel tracks**: HAR-11 (Linear webhooks), HAR-12 (Linear API client), HAR-13 (Claude sessions)
  - **Sequential**: HAR-14 (Communication) → HAR-16 (Distribution) ← HAR-15 (Task parser)
  - **Final**: HAR-17 (Integration testing)
- **Status**: Issues created in Linear, ready for subagent assignment
- **Next**: Subagents can work on parallel tracks (HAR-11, HAR-12, HAR-13) after foundations (HAR-8, HAR-10) are complete

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 17:45  
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: Added Linear dependency management capability
- **Created `linear-dependencies.ts`**: Simple CLI tool to create blocking relationships between Linear issues
  - Usage: `bun linear-dependencies.ts <blockingIssueId> <blockedIssueId>`
  - Example: `bun linear-dependencies.ts HAR-8 HAR-10` (✅ tested successfully)
- **Integration**: Uses existing `createBlockingRelation` function from `taskboard/utils.ts`
- **Capability**: Can now assign dependencies between issues when creating new tasks in the future
- **Status**: Tool tested and ready for managing Linear issue dependencies as needed

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 19:30  
**Agent**: Claude Code (Opus)
**Changes**: Pivoted to simplified MVP - Direct Claude Code launching from Linear
- **Created `taskboard/claude-launcher.ts`**: Core module for spawning Claude Code instances
  - Launches Claude Code in headless mode using `--print` flag for non-interactive execution
  - Uses `--allowedTools` to grant permissions for file editing and git operations
  - Generates action-oriented prompts that instruct Claude to execute tasks, not just describe them
  - Monitors Claude execution output and detects task completion
  - Updates Linear issue with progress comments
- **Enhanced `taskboard/server.ts`**: Integrated Claude launcher with webhook
  - Automatically launches Claude Code when issues assigned to target user (Arihan)
  - Checks for blocked dependencies before launching
  - Prevents duplicate sessions for same issue
  - Added `/api/status` endpoint to monitor active Claude sessions
- **Key Discovery**: Claude Code's `--print` mode with `--allowedTools` can actually execute tasks
  - Can edit files, run git commands, and perform real work autonomously
  - Not just Q&A but actual task execution in headless mode
- **Next Steps**: Test with real Linear webhook and refine prompt engineering for better task execution
