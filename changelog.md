### **Date**: 2025-08-10 06:30
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: PM Board project setup and issue creation
- **Created PM Board Project**: "PM Board" in Linear workspace
- **Created 9 issues** (HAR-8 to HAR-17) with dependency structure for parallel subagent development:
  - **Foundation**: HAR-8 (Database schema) → HAR-10 (API server)
  - **Parallel tracks**: HAR-11 (Linear webhooks), HAR-12 (Linear API client), HAR-13 (Claude sessions)
  - **Sequential**: HAR-14 (Communication) → HAR-16 (Distribution) ← HAR-15 (Task parser)
  - **Final**: HAR-17 (Integration testing)
- **Status**: Issues created in Linear, ready for subagent assignment
- **Next**: Subagents can work on parallel tracks (HAR-11, HAR-12, HAR-13) after foundations (HAR-8, HAR-10) are complete

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 17:45  
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: Added Linear dependency management capability
- **Created `linear-dependencies.ts`**: Simple CLI tool to create blocking relationships between Linear issues
  - Usage: `bun linear-dependencies.ts <blockingIssueId> <blockedIssueId>`
  - Example: `bun linear-dependencies.ts HAR-8 HAR-10` (✅ tested successfully)
- **Integration**: Uses existing `createBlockingRelation` function from `taskboard/utils.ts`
- **Capability**: Can now assign dependencies between issues when creating new tasks in the future
- **Status**: Tool tested and ready for managing Linear issue dependencies as needed

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 19:30  
**Agent**: Claude Code (Opus)
**Changes**: Pivoted to simplified MVP - Direct Claude Code launching from Linear
- **Created `taskboard/claude-launcher.ts`**: Core module for spawning Claude Code instances
  - Launches Claude Code in headless mode using `--print` flag for non-interactive execution
  - Uses `--allowedTools` to grant permissions for file editing and git operations
  - Generates action-oriented prompts that instruct Claude to execute tasks, not just describe them
  - Monitors Claude execution output and detects task completion
  - Updates Linear issue with progress comments
- **Enhanced `taskboard/server.ts`**: Integrated Claude launcher with webhook
  - Automatically launches Claude Code when issues assigned to target user (Arihan)
  - Checks for blocked dependencies before launching
  - Prevents duplicate sessions for same issue
  - Added `/api/status` endpoint to monitor active Claude sessions
- **Key Discovery**: Claude Code's `--print` mode with `--allowedTools` can actually execute tasks
  - Can edit files, run git commands, and perform real work autonomously
  - Not just Q&A but actual task execution in headless mode
- **Next Steps**: Test with real Linear webhook and refine prompt engineering for better task execution

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 22:45
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: HAR-ORH-1 - Enhanced dependency checking utility for task orchestration
- **Enhanced `taskboard/utils.ts`**: Added detailed dependency checking capability
  - `checkTaskDependencies(taskId)` - Returns comprehensive dependency status for orchestration
  - Extends existing `isIssueBlocked()` with detailed blocking task information
  - Returns structured `DependencyStatus` object with `isBlocked`, `blockingTasks[]`, `readyToDispatch`  
  - Includes task identifiers, titles, and current states for blocked dependencies
  - Error handling returns safe defaults (blocked=true) to prevent invalid dispatches
- **Integration Ready**: Other orchestration components can now make informed dispatch decisions
  - Usage: `const status = await checkTaskDependencies('task-id'); if (status.readyToDispatch) { /* dispatch */ }`
  - Blocking tasks include full context: `{id, identifier, title, state}` for debugging/UI
- **Type Safety**: Added TypeScript interface `DependencyStatus` with proper exports
- **Status**: Ready for integration with task dispatcher and worker pool manager

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 23:15
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: HAR-ORH-1 - Fixed dependency detection logic (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
- **Fixed `taskboard/utils.ts`**: Corrected both `isIssueBlocked()` and `checkTaskDependencies()` functions
  - **Root Cause**: Linear's `relations()` API only returns outgoing relationships, not incoming blocks
  - **Solution**: Search through all team issues to find ones that block the target issue
  - **Logic Fix**: Changed from checking issue's own relations to searching team-wide for `relatedIssueId === targetId`
  - **Verified Working**: HAR-11 now correctly detected as blocked by HAR-10 "In Progress" 
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test with real Linear data confirms dependency detection works
  - Before: `isIssueBlocked('HAR-11') = false` (WRONG)
  - After: `isIssueBlocked('HAR-11') = true` (CORRECT)
  - Shows detailed blocking task: "HAR-10: Core API server with webhook endpoints (In Progress)"
- **Performance**: Searches team issues but caches results, acceptable for typical team sizes
- **Status**: Dependency checker now fully functional for orchestration system integration

### **Date**: 2025-08-10 [Current Session]
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: Enhanced Claude Code launcher with tmux session management and scheduling
- **Enhanced `taskboard/claude-launcher.ts`**: Added comprehensive tmux session management
  - **Tmux Integration**: Claude Code instances now run in managed tmux sessions (`claude-worker-N`)
  - **Session Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of tmux sessions with 30-second health checks
  - **Worker Scheduling**: Intelligent worker assignment and reuse of available tmux sessions
  - **Session Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of worker assignments and monitoring intervals
  - **Status Tracking**: Enhanced session tracking with tmux session names and worker numbers
- **Enhanced `taskboard/server.ts`**: Added tmux session status monitoring
  - **New Endpoint**: `/api/tmux` - Lists all active Claude worker tmux sessions
  - **Enhanced `/api/status`**: Now includes tmux session and worker number information
- **Features Added**:
  - Automatic tmux worker creation when no workers available
  - Session reuse for efficiency and resource management  
  - Monitoring intervals that detect task completion via `TASK_COMPLETE:` markers
  - Proper worker cleanup when tasks complete or sessions are killed
- **Testing**: Created `test-tmux-launcher.ts` for verification of tmux integration
- **Status**: Claude Code tasks now launch in managed tmux sessions with proper scheduling

### **Date**: 2025-08-11 [Current Session]
**Agent**: Claude Code SuperClaude  
**Changes**: HAR-48 - Implemented fibonacci number generator
- **Created `fibonacci.ts`**: Generates and prints the first 1000 fibonacci numbers
  - Uses BigInt for large number handling to avoid overflow
  - Exports `generateFibonacci()` and `printFirstNFibonacci()` functions
  - Includes proper docstring for interface description
  - Runs directly with `bun run fibonacci.ts` to print all 1000 numbers
- **Created `fibonacci.test.ts`**: Integration test for fibonacci generation
  - Validates first 10 fibonacci numbers match expected sequence
  - Confirms 1000 numbers are generated correctly
  - Tests large number handling (1000th fibonacci number)
- **Status**: HAR-48 complete, fibonacci generator working correctly with proper testing
