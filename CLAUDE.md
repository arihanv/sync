# Project Overview
You should consult the linear project overview to get a grasp on the project requirements. Note, the main information will be stored on a project not issue level. We should start every session by consulting the project description, reading the changelog to see what's already been built out, and then checking the active issues that aren't in progress to get started on them.

## How to develop code
- Do NOT use emojis when writing your code.
- Keep your change fairly minimalistic. I want you to reduce the number of comments that you write as well. 
- To verify that things are working, we should add tests but these tests should be minimalistic and only check for integration level things - not random unit tests
- Frequently commit your code as you go through the development process, so we can be sure that we're tracking our work properly. 
- For each new feature/linear issue, create a separate git branch that you work out of
- It's possible that we'll eventually have multiple agents working collaboratively, so on each feature you should also add docstrings, which describe how to interface with this feature.

## How to communicate across agents. 
- Since multiple agents are going to be working on this feature together, maintain a summary of the changes that you made in changelog.md


# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
